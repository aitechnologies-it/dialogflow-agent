# dfagent ðŸ¤–
The dfagent is a package for the handling of Dialogflow agents. You can retrieve training examples and save into a preferred format.

## Overview

* [dfagent/](dfagent) contains all the core code to extend dfagent.

## Install

To install the dfagent package you only need to run [install.sh](install.sh) script.

## Usage

Once dfagent is installed you can simply import it in your code. The following snippet illustrates a simple example to get and save training examples from an online Dialogflow agent.

To create a Dialogflow agent you only need that

```Python
import dfagent

agent = dfagent.DialogFlowAgent(
    local_path_or_url='project_name',
    service_account='path/to/dir/',
    content_type='json',
    output_format='default'
)
```

In case you already have exported your Dialogflow on your local computer, you can give as local_path_or_url the path to the zip or unzipped exported agent.

Then you can get a list of dialogflow examples for saving as follows

```Python
examples = agent.get_training_examples()
agent.save_training_examples(examples, output_dir='path/to/dir')
```
